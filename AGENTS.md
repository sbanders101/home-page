# AGENTS.md
Operating rules for Codex CLI in this repo

Read first:
- CODEX_BRIEF.md (overall context and constraints)
- ROADMAP.md (work top to bottom, first unchecked item only)

Before changing code:
- Update PLAN.md with the Goal + a short Plan (3–7 steps) for the single roadmap item you are doing.

As you work:
- Append to PLAN.md under Progress and Decisions.
- Keep changes small and targeted. Don’t refactor unrelated stuff.

Scope control:
- Do ONE ROADMAP checkbox per run, unless it is truly tiny and safe to bundle.
- Preserve legacy pages under `public/legacy/`. Do not delete them.

Finish:
- Mark the ROADMAP checkbox as complete.
- Summarize what changed and how to run/preview locally.
